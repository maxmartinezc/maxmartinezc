# :smile: Max Martinez

An enthusiastic software engineer who is passionate about producing high-quality work and has a solid ability for learn, adapt and grow. During the course of my more than ten- year career, I have developed a great capacity for creating software and everything related to the profession.

Iâ€™ve worked for firms that provided me with valuable experiences as a software engineer and as a person as well. Each one involved incredible challenge that allowed me to work on high-performance initiatives across numerous business lines. Also, I enjoy working in a collaborative environment that promotes cross-disciplinary collaboration.
